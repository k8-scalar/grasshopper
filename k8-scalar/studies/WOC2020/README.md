The code of this project has been implemented by Arnout Hoebreckx and Cedric De Dycker as part of their master thesis at KU Leuven, academy year 2019-2020.

Based on their work, a [short paper](https://doi.org/10.1145/3429885.3429963), entitled Flexible Migration in Blue-Green Deployments within a Fixed Cost, has been publiced at the WOC 2020 workshop.

The [analytical model](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/lwsphz3nbo), describede in this paper, is based on the [master thesis](./2020_ArnoutHoebreckx_Masterproef.pdf) of Arnout. More practical information for understanding the code and running the experiments in this project can explained in this master thesis.
